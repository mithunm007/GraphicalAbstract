AI Strategy
Strategic Alignment
Have we clearly
defined how AI
initiatives directly
support business
objectives?
Does our leadership
actively endorse AI
as a strategic
priority?
Are AI initiatives
included explicitly in
our strategic plan?
Have we identified
clear business
outcomes expected
from AI initiatives?
Is the AI strategy
aligned and
communicated
across all business
units?
Have we clearly
assessed our
internal AI skills and
identified capability
gaps?
Have we evaluated
our current data
maturity and
infrastructure
readiness?
Is there a dedicated
budget for AI skills
training and
infrastructure
improvement?
Do we regularly
audit our readiness
for upcoming AI
projects?
Do we know the
external resources
or partners needed
to fill capability
gaps?
Have we
identified and
documented
practical AI use
cases across our
business units?
Have we
conducted a
formal AIopportunity
prioritization
exercise?
Do we regularly
involve business
stakeholders in
AI opportunity
discovery
workshops?
Do we have a
defined
framework or
criteria to
prioritize AI
projects (ROI,
feasibility)?
Is our leadership
team actively
involved in AI
use-case
selection?
Have we
defined a
phased
roadmap for AI
implementation?
Is there a
structured
process for
piloting AI
solutions before
scaling?
Have we clearly
identified shortterm (quick-win)
AI initiatives?
Do we have
contingency
plans in place
for AI project
delays or
challenges?
Is the AI
roadmap
regularly
reviewed and
updated by
stakeholders?
Have we clearly
identified key
risks associated
with our AI
initiatives?
Is there a formal
governance
framework for
managing AI
ethics and
compliance?
Have we clearly
assigned
accountability
for AI initiatives
at leadership
level?
Are our risk
management
practices
regularly
reviewed and
adjusted?
Do we have
mechanisms to
address ethical
and regulatory
considerations
of AI?
Business Case First Approach
Instead of asking:
“How can we use AI?”
Start by asking:
“What business problem is worth solving —
and can AI help solve it better?
